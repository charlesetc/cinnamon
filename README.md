# Cinnamon Structural Editor


## Build

```bash
> npm install
> npm run build
```

## Serve

```bash
> npm run bundle
> npm run serve
```

The app is served at `localhost:3000`

NB: `purescript-ocelot` uses a modified version of `tailwind.css`. In order to avoid pulling in all setup into the project I am just using the standard cdn distribution of tailwind which is why it looks wonky.
